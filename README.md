# 🍅 Pomodoro Timer

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a simple time management method that helps you stay focused and avoid burnout.
You work in short, focused sessions — usually 25 minutes long — followed by a 5-minute break.
After four sessions, you take a longer break to rest and recharge.

It’s a great way to break big tasks into manageable chunks and keep your mind fresh while working.
